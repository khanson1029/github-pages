For nine days Odysseus and his crew sailed over the shining sea, striking the water ceaselessly with their oars, and on the tenth the great isle of Protothespia heaved into sight, where, they say, never does the all-revealing Sun set, and a man who never sleeps could earn double wages, one for shepherding, and one for devouring hapless passersby. But here indeed there were no giants, no shepherds calling out to one another, and the land remained unplowed, unsown, unseeded, yielding no harvest of any sort. For this isle was sacred to earth-shaker Poseidon. And as when a great fish, flopping around helplessly and randomly on barren land, finally manages to flop back into the lake whence it was removed, rejoices in its heart, thus indeed the companions of Odysseus were cheered by the sight of dry land. And they begged him with sweet words to put ashore, but Odysseus recalled the prophecies of the enchantress Circe, godlike among the goddesses, and he spoke winged words unto them .
